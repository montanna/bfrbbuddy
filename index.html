					<p><span>L</span>ast January, my roommate and I packed our bags and set off on the adventure of a lifetime: our semester abroad in Preston, England. Preston is kind of like the Fresno of England, in that when exchange students show up there, the first question locals ask is usually "Why did you come <i>here?"</i></p>
					<p> It's a genuinely charming city with a lively downtown, a beautiful museum, and tons of historic buildings. But when we researched it beforehand, the biggest selling point we could find was that Preston has the cheapest pints anywhere in England. </p>
					<p> We figured we'd feel right at home.</p>

					<p><span>W</span>hen we arrived, our host, Mary, had the loveliest breakfast spread out for us in the morning. Her home is so cozy and welcoming â€” a five-story Georgian townhouse shared with her three children and many cats. We got a bit lost in the process of lugging our belongings from London to Preston, and when we finally dragged our luggage from the rain into her house at 11 p.m., I was so happy that I actually cried.</p>
